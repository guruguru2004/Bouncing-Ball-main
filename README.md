Hereâ€™s a README template for a bouncing ball project. You can tailor it to fit your specific implementation and features.

Bouncing Ball Project
Overview
The Bouncing Ball Project simulates the motion of a ball that bounces within a defined area. This project demonstrates basic physics principles such as gravity, elasticity, and collision detection.

Features

Realistic Bouncing: The ball bounces off walls and responds to gravity.

Customizable Parameters: Adjust the ball's size, speed, and bounciness.

Interactive Controls: Start, pause, and reset the simulation with user input.

Visual Effects: Optional visual effects for enhanced realism.
